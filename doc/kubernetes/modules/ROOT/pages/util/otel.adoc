= Tracing and additional metrics with OpenTelemetry
:description: Collect traces and additional metrics using OpenTelemetry during development and performance runs.

{description}

[NOTE]
====
This setup is only for load tests with the Keycloak Benchmark Project.

To find more about how to use tracing in Keycloak, visit the https://www.keycloak.org/observability/tracing[Observability Guide on tracing].

== Setting up OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is disabled by default.
It needs to be enabled via the customizing the setting `xref:customizing-deployment.adoc#KC_OTEL[KC_OTEL]`.

Depending on the setting `xref:customizing-deployment.adoc#KC_OTEL_SAMPLING_PERCENTAGE[KC_OTEL_SAMPLING_PERCENTAGE]`, only a percentage of traces might be recorded for performance reasons.

[CAUTION]
====
Contrary to other setups, this is not using an OpenTelemetry collector, but instead sends traces directly to Jaeger.

== Accessing OpenTelemetry traces

Grafana and Jaeger can be used to access the traces, and both are deployed by default.

Assuming the command `minikube ip` returned `192.168.39.39`, Grafana is available on \http://grafana.192.168.39.39.nip.io, and Jaeger is available on \http://jaeger.192.168.39.39.nip.io

Use the browser to search for traces in Grafana via the Jaeger data source, or use the Jaeger UI directly.

When searching for traces in Grafana, select at least the service `keycloak` to see traces.
The results can be restricted further using the operation and the tags of the trace.

The Jaeger UI is similar.
As in the Grafana UI, select the Keycloak service to before searching.

To find out more about the tool, visit the https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger homepage].

[NOTE]
====
After running a search in the Jaeger UI, the search timestamp is fixed and encoded in the URL.
Therefore, re-running the search or setting different filter options will not find traces which were created after running the first search.
To start a search with the latest timestamp, click on **Search** in the menu toolbar.
